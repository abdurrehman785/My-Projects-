        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Abdur Rehman, a passionate Computer Engineering student at Ghulam Ishaq Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology. My journey into the world of technology has led me to discover a newfound love for web development, where I find the perfect blend of creativity and technical skill.
            <br><br>
            Web development isn't just a field for meâ€”it's a canvas where I bring ideas to life, combining aesthetics with functionality. As I continue to grow and learn, I strive to push the boundaries of what I can create, aiming to develop websites that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.
            <br><br>
            In addition to my technical pursuits, I am constantly exploring new ways to innovate and stay ahead in the ever-evolving world of web development. Whether it's front-end design or back-end development, I am dedicated to crafting high-quality digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
